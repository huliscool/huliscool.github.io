<h1> welcome to the nhk (brief nsfw daydream scenes)</h1>
<p>when i was at college, i lived alone in an apartment in the city. i started staying awake until 8am, and spent longer and longer stretches of time without leaving home. there was an unmarked white van that parked in the alleyway across the street from my front window. there were always people on the sidewalk outside. my neighbor would bang on my floor (his ceiling) when i walked around to go to the bathroom at night. this was my life when i first watched <i>Welcome to the NHK</i>.</p>
<p>this anime deals with hikkikomori (shut-in) lifestyle, paranoia/conspiracy, cynicism, and internet addiction. for anyone who deals with any of these issues, i would reccomend checking out this show. the main character is a college student who dropped out due to paranoia and crippling anxiety (me). the series follows him as he attempts to break out of his shut-in lifestyle (and reconnects with friends from his previous life), after an encounter with a possible conspiracy.</p>
<p>24 ep. average anime aesthetic (bright, colorful). mezzo-forte animation. rock music, but occasionally dark. funny, slightly emotional if you can relate to the mental illnesses. i may re-watch this (i watched the first 4 episodes last night instead of working on this site).</p>
<p>i actually don't have a good link for this right now, but i trust that you can find it if you just google "welcome to the nhk ep 1 eng sub"!</p>

<p>i know what you're thinking... how can a shut-in be friends with so many girls?? you'll just have to watch to find out!!</p>
