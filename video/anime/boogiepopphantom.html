  <h1>boogiepop phantom (gore)</h1>
  <p>i started watching <i>Boogiepop Phantom</i> because of <i>Paranoia Agent</i>, which was the first anime i had ever seen, in middle school (?). <i>Paranoia Agent</i> was syndicated on [adult swim], which is how my cousin chris first saw it, and then he showed it to me. this was a mistake, because it lead me down a path from which i have never recovered. (i love using the word "which".)</p>
  <p>anyways, fast forward a few years, and i really wanted to watch something similar to <i>Paranoia Agent</i>. i read on some forum that fans had considered there to be an unofficial trilogy between <i>Paranoia Agent</i>, <i>Boogiepop Phantom</i>, and <i>Serial Experiments Lain</i>. i have also seen <i>Lain</i>, though idk if before or after <i>Boogiepop</i>. i also did not understand <i>Lain</i> at all. now that i think about it tho, i don't think that i really understood <i>Boogiepop</i> very well either, at least at the time of watching it. however, the soundscaping, general visual aesthetic, and action puilled me in and held my attention.</p>
  <p>this anime follows a mystery. like <i>Serial Experiments Lain</i>, the story revolves around highschool students who disappear, and supernatural forces with unclear intentions. like <i>Paranoia Agent</i>, there are vigilante heroes and questionable realities.</p>
  <p>tho i do not remember much of the plot, the visual aesthetic and psychological tension of this show heavily shaped my current point of view in my music.</p>
  <p>12 ep (easy watching!). dark, brooding aesthetic (uses a lot of those vignetted filters that you see in cop show flashbacks; i find this slightly frustrating, but it's worth it to stick with it bc this is a GOOD show). 90's animation style; looks a little dated now, but again, it's worth it. BEAUTIFUL sound environments; similar to a light-handed take on AHS soundscaping, mostly rock/metal music, but i believe there's at least one sick elctro song in there. mystery/psychological triller/horror. i've started re-watching it a million times, but i think i've only seen it one (maybe two) times. there are also manga. i also just found out that there's a live-action movie (<i>Boogiepop and Others</i>), so i may watch that soon.</p>
  <p>sorry, i also don't have a ilnk for this yet either! just google "boogiepop phantom ep 1 eng sub", and hopefully you can find something! but be careful tho, bc a lot of the versions that i found are actually eng dub WITH subs too. (i know! why would they do that??)</p>
